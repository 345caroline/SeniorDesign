With the help of hardware such as Raspberry Pis and Zigbee Dev Boards, our initiative aims to build a testing configuration that identifies and addresses vulnerabilities in wireless IoT technologies, with a focus on real-world applicability in aircraft. While last semester focused mostly on background research, general test bed design, and simple actions, the focus of these next few months are the applications of devices like Flipper Zero and Zigbee. Particular attention will be given to risk assessment, BLE, our aviation use cases, and data logging. By the end of the semester, we plan to implement what we have learned from the previous semester and explore ways Bluetooth 5.3(2021), or possibly earlier versions as well, can be exploited. Using specified operating systems such as Kali Linux, as well as our own code, to find possible vulnerabilities when it comes to the initial connection as well as the reach of information one would be able to access from outside the connection.
