With the help of hardware such as Raspberry Pis and Zigbee Dev Boards, our initiative aims to build a testing configuration that identifies and addresses vulnerabilities in wireless IoT technologies, with a focus on real-world applicability in aircraft. By the end of the semester, we plan to learn about the protocols and security systems that currently surround Bluetooth 5.3(2021) or possibly earlier versions as not all applications are up to date. Using specified operating systems such as Kali Linux as well as our own code to find possible vulnerabilities when it comes to the initial connection one makes to a device or prolonged connections. As well as the reach of information one would be able to access from outside the connection (i.e. information about the source or destination).
